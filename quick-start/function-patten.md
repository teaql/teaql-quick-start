## WRITING FORMAT ##

Dear users, there is a writing format in IntlliJ IDEA. If you have learnt about Java,  
it's a piece of a cake for you.  

But if not, just follow the regulation below. 


1. Think about what information you want to see.  

    eg. you want to query kids list of Mia's family. 


2. write down the function. 

    eg. Take the scenario mentioned in the first point as an exampleï¼Œ you can write the function like this.

**Precautions**
    
1. *CamelCase*

    When you name a variable, if there are more than two words, the first letter of the first word is lowercase, and the first letter of the following words is uppercase.  
    
    eg. `helloMia` and `familyList` in the picture above followed the CamelCase.  
      
2. *necessary format*  
    
    + Starts with `public Webresponse` and ends with `return`. 
    + Mark each sentence with a semicolon. 
    + As for `SmartList<Family>`, when you write down the variable of familyList, IntelliJ IDEA will prompt you and fill it in automatically for you.  
    

3. *consistent*  

    eg. If you create a variable that named familyList, you must use `Q.family()`. 
    If you create a variable that named kidList, you must use`Q.kid()`. 
    

4. *!*
    
    It represents **not**
    
    
    
5. *E*
    
    It represent **expression**

6. *JSON's garammar*
    
    When you use Postman and the method you select is **PUT**, you need to use JSON,and its format is below.  
    `{"name":"something"}`
