## MODEL PATTEN ##

Dear user, you can create a system model like this.  

There is a example below. 

![](images/model-patten.png)

this is a system of a community, 

Write them down according to the inclusion relationship, but after each object is created, it must be marked to which object it belongs like the picture above.  

For example, the family belongs to the community. At the end of the family list, add `community="community()`. and so on


Another note is that every time you create an object, you need to add `<` and `/>` before and after the list respectively.


You can use the tab key or space bar during the process to ensure alignment.
